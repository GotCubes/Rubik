# Rubik
Rubik's cube emulator and solver that emphasizes retention of the beginner's method. User can perform rotations on the virtual cube using an array of buttons indicating the types of moves available. A button exists to scramble the cube by performing several random moves until the cube is adequately scrambled. The solve button walks the user through the beginner's method of solving the cube, outputting the solution in standardized notation in a basic console. Additionally, the user can manually change the stickers of the emulator to mimic a real cube, for which the generated solution will solve the physical cube as well as the virtual.
